# 4-PAM-Simulation
4-PAM Digital Communication System Simulation 

This project consists of a simulation of a DCS vector model which implements 4-PAM technique. It includes a plot of the simulated probability of bit error as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio per bit compared to the expected theoretical values. The detector is assumed to be a single correlation-type demodulator. 

I completed this project at the University of Surrey, UK. The report and code can be found on [Link to Report](4_PAM_DCS.pdf)
